# Sites for Practices

Take note that almost all programming practice code challenges out there are already hard (for a literal beginner). So better be prepared to get stuck on a lot of questions specially since most questions are **Data Structures and Algorithms** _(DSA)_, or some concepts in programming 2 (i.e., structs, unions, enums, files, sorting algorithms, ADT and more).

Take for example the second question on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/), one needs to know the concept of a linked list and how to implement a it (pointer-to-node, pointer-to-pointer-to-node).

I might argue to just use any GPT-AI tools to generate some practice questions about that topic. Although most of the time they do generate easy practice exercises.
